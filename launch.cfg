# This script is not made for migrating versions.                  #
# If you're migrating versions you're doing at your own risk.      #
# If you still want to migrate versions, you can do so just by     #
# changing the select_version variable to the version you want     #
# to migrate to.                                                   #
# You'll be warned if you're about to migrate versions.            #
# I recommend backing up your world and settings.                  #
# I am not responsible for any loss of data                        #

# Memory settings
#
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #
# Do not allocate all of your available memory on a shared host! #
# Minecraft (and Java) needs to have more memory than the Xmx    #
# parameter (maxMem below). You should set it at least 1500M     #
# lower than your available memory if you're running just the    #
# minecraft server.                                              #
